Hi! I'm Giuliano, a PhD student in statistics at the [Korthauer lab](https://www.korthauerlab.com/) from [The University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/). My research interests include clinical prediction modelling using omics features, Bayesian statistics, and decision analysis. I am also a Bioinformatics Scientist at [BiomeHub](https://www.biome-hub.com/pesquisa), a biotech startup from Brazil, where I provide statistics guidance for clinical microbiome research and write production-ready software for omics data analysis. I earned my MSc in bioinformatics from UBC, also at the Korthauer lab, and my title of pharmacist from the [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home), in Brazil.

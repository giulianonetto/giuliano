Bioinformatician trained as a Pharmacist. Data science experience includes predictive modeling, Bayesian analysis, data visualization, and genomics. I have mostly worked with microbiome and gene expression data, but also with scanning electron microscopy and other types of data. I have worked with web development and dynamical reporting routines applied to scientific problems, for both research and production. I have teaching experience in the fields of basic and clinical Immunology as well as intro data science and statistics.

I am passionate about human health and disease, statistical modeling, and the everyday's [chimarr√£o](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%A9_(drink)).

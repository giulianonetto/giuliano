Hi! I'm Giuliano, a Pharmacist Bioinformatician from the South of Brazil. Currently, I'm a master's student in [Dr. Keegan Korthauer's lab](https://kkorthauer.org/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). As a researcher, I am particularly interested in answering the following question: **how can we navigate the omics universe to deliver reliable and deployable clinical prediction models?** Hopefully, using cool statistical modeling and rigorous epidemiological designs, we can ultimately aid in diagnosing, prognosing, and treating life-threatening diseases.

As [Professor Cortella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Sergio_Cortella) once said:

> Há duas coisas na vida que, se você guardar, você perde: conhecimento e afeto. Se você guardar, eles vão embora. A única maneira de ter conhecimento e afeto é reparti-los.

In plain English, he says there are two things in life that you loose as you keep for yourself: affection and knowledge. Kept for oneself, they are actually gone. The only way to preserve affection and knowledge, Cortella says, is through sharing.

The learning process, I believe, needs not to be kept for ourselves. Rather, it ~~can~~ _should_ be shared - just like knowledge and affection. Here, I will make public a few challenges I face while learning health data science. This is also a disclaimer: __I am learning__. Hopefully, one day all this might serve you as well.

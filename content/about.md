My name is Giuliano, and I am a Brazilian Bioinformatician who loves stats and stories. I graduated as a Pharmacist from the [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home) in 2019. I spent most of my undergrad studying Immunology & Microbiology. I have lived in the USA for about a year. During the summer of 2015, I had the opportunity to do reseach at the [Rohwer Lab](https://coralandphage.org/) in San Diego. In 2018, one year after starting exploring the field of bioinformatics, I was accepted as an intern at [Neoprospecta Microbiome Technologies](https://www.neoprospecta.com/en/). I was focused on microbiome data analysis applied to track down microorganisms in food industries, hospital environments, and the random sort of possible scenarios. 

After graduation, I became "formally" a Bioinformatician, thanks to the great working environment at "Neo" and the mentoring from many great people. Beyond data analysis, we were responsible for creating, maintaining, and operating analytical pipelines and web applications, mostly based on python and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). 

Around the middle of 2019, I became a Bioinformatician at [BiomeHub](https://www.biome-hub.com/), Neoprospecta's spin-off focused on health care. My research would now be focused on developing statistical models to estimate bacterial colony-forming units from NGS data. As you might know, NGS is thought to yield [relative information only](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/16/2870/4956011). It would be nice, however, to be able to tell the difference between two samples with 50% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, if one has $10^2$ CFU while the other one has, say, $10^5$ CFU. This was our most recent research task (besides all COVID-19 stuff, of course). Our results are currently [available on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.932301v2), in case you are interested. 

This is just to summarise my short academic life so far. As I was working my way through it, I also learned a lot. I am particularly interested in statistical modeling of human health data. It might be microbiome, gene expression, image data, or anything related to human health! 

I consider myself a Bioinformatician, as you may have noticed, but I never left my Pharmacy background behind. As I move forward, my ultimate goal is to better integrate mathematical modeling with health [care & caring](https://doi.org/10.3747/co.21.2239). This means not only complex mathematics, data, and coding, but even more complex aspects of the Health Sciences. At the end of the day, decision making is to be made at the clinic, and that is the very place where I dream my science will make an impact one day.
